# Flowstake / Hashrun

## Activity Staking Blockchain Network

### Public, Immutable, Activity Records

* Activity Files Encrypted into IPFS
* Escrow Time Release Proof of Activity Smart Contract 
* Hybrid Proof of Stake / Proof of Authority 

Activity verified on the blockchain network
Operate a validator node or stake the network 
Validator nodes verify and store hashes using the IPFS protocol.
IPFS protocol generates secure & reliable records for proof of activity.

Compiling trackpoints of GPS & accelerometer data from sensors on mobile & wearable devices.
Parsing activity data into distributed encrypted ledgers with Blockchain technology.

Example smart contract - Staking ETH into escrow time based contract to prove activity to the network on every 24hrs. 
Trackpoint metrics analyze 1 minute segments - analyzing data for Max Accelration, Max Speed & Activity Duration

-  Proof of Activity as a Stake - Validators
    - To ensure network consensus & valid activity data, each node must process transactions to secure network activity.

- Mining and Encrypting Activity Real Time
    - Requirements - Trackpoint Data
    - Smart Contract - Mining Activity to Generate Blocks
        - Throughput Requirements for Sigining Activity Live - 1 min / 60 seconds - (60 tracepoints)
        - Live Active Validator - 1 hour / 60 mins / 3600 seconds (3,600 transactions)
        - Live Active Validator - 24 hours / 1440 minutes / 86,400 seconds (86,400 transactions) 

- Token Generation Event - Network Protocol Generates Tokens for Verified Activity Time
    - Proof of Activity - Token Generation Event as a result of hybrid computational networks, recording and encrypting activity information, second per second track points.
    - Proving human activity to stake reputation on the Proof of Activity as a Stake network.
    - Hashing activity from sports tracking apps into IPFS.
    - Parsing activity data & digitally signing it into the network.
