# Flowstake 

Activity Staking Blockchain Network


Activity Files Encrypted into IPFS 

Full Activity Processed Into the Blockchain
Master-nodes verify and store ledgers using IPFS + digital flowstake smart contract signature.

Parsing activity data into distributed encrypted ledgers via activity streaming protocol through IPFS.
Record trackpoints of GPS & accelerometer information into sensors built into mobile devices & wearable devices connected via rP2P or through https / ipfs.
Digital signatures into each blocktime to verify with activity staking contract.
Time Based Records & Staking via smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Trackpoint metrics analyzed segments analyzed, tokens generated 1 per min.
P2P private IPFS nodes building secure, reliable sports records for proof of activity.

-  Proof of Activity - Masternode
    - Network consensus, validators must mine for 15 days to secure network Activity 
    - Network consents, validators must mine / process 6 hours of activity 

- Mining and Encrypting Activity Real Time
    - Requirements - Blockchain Codebase
    - Smart Contract Signing Digital Activity
    - Activity Mining to Generate Transactions 
        - Activity Requirements for Digital Signature - 1 min / 60 seconds - (60 tracepoints)
        - Active Validator - 60 mins / 3600 seconds (3,600 transactions)
        - Active Master Node - 24 hours / 1440 minutes 

- Blockchain Mining - Network Protocol Generates Tokens for Activity Time
    - Token Generation Event as the Utility of Proof of Activity
    - Token Generation Event as a result of Proof of Activity, Proof of Elapsed Time & Proof of Work hybrid computational networks, securely recording and encrypting activity information, trace & track points real time from wearable devices. 
    - Tokens rewards, are activity minutes human activity in combination with Proof of Authority & Staking Consensus to generate time tokens that can be held in a wallet to generate tokens 

- Signing Activity with Mobile Wallet & Scanning Proof of Authority QR Codes to improve network consensus
- Embedding Activity Digital Signatures into Activity Data
- Zero Knowledge Proof of Activity as a Stake
