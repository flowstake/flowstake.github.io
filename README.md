Activity Staking Blockchain Network

Public, Immutable, Activity Records

Activity Files Encrypted into IPFS
Capser Proof of Stake
Smart Contract Staking

Activity Verified on the Blockchain
Validator nodes verify and store hashes using IPFS.
IPFS protocol generates secure & reliable records for proof of activity.

Parsing activity data into distributed encrypted ledgers with Blockchain technology. 
Compiling trackpoints of GPS & accelerometer data from sensors on mobile & wearable devices.

Example smart contract - Staking ETH into escrow time based contract to prove activity to the network on every 24hrs. 
Trackpoint metrics analyze 1 minute segments - analyzing data for Max Accelration, Max Speed & Activity Duration

-  Proof of Activity as a Stake - Validators
    - To ensure network consensus & valid activity data, each node must process transactions to secure network activity.

- Mining and Encrypting Activity Real Time
    - Requirements - Trackpoint Data
    - Smart Contract - Mining Activity to Generate Blocks
        - Throughput Requirements for Sigining Activity Live - 1 min / 60 seconds - (60 tracepoints)
        - Live Active Validator - 1 hour / 60 mins / 3600 seconds (3,600 transactions)
        - Live Active Validator - 24 hours / 1440 minutes / 86,400 seconds (86,400 transactions) 

- Token Generation Event - Network Protocol Generates Tokens for Verified Activity Time
    - Proof of Activity - Token Generation Event as a result of hybrid computational networks, recording and encrypting activity information, second per second track points.
    - Proving human activity to stake reputation on the Proof of Activity as a Stake network.
    - Hashing activity from sports tracking apps into IPFS.
    - Parsing activity data & digitally signing it into the network.
