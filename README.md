### FlowStake / Hashrun - Activity Staking Blockchain Network
* Public, Immutable, Activity Records
* Public Activity Files Hashed into IPFS protocol
* Proof of Activity as Stake Consensus Mechanism
* Hybrid Proof of Stake / Proof of Activity

## Proof of Activity 

Data ownership, Content addressed storage, Hash addressed Activity Trackpoints
IPFS has given the users the power of content-addressed storage.
IPFS protocol generates secure & reliable records for proof of activity.
Compiling trackpoints of GPS & accelerometer data from sensors on mobile & wearable devices.
Parsing activity data into distributed encrypted ledgers with Blockchain technology.

Proof of Activity Smart Contract - Staking proof of activity events into escrow smart contracts with time based release to prove consistent, recoccuring runtime / activity on timechain. Trackpoint metrics analyze 1 minute segments - analyzing data for Max Accelration, Max Speed & Activity Duration

-  Proof of Activity as a Stake - Validators
    * To ensure network consensus & valid activity data, each node must process transactions to secure network activity.
    * Activity timestamp hash verified on the blockchain network
    * Operate a validator node to stake the network 
    * Validator nodes verify proof of activity IPFS timestamps

- Mining and Encrypting Activity Real Time
    - Requirements - Trackpoint Data
    - Smart Contract - Mining Activity to Generate Blocks
        - Throughput Requirements for Sigining Activity Live - 1 min / 60 seconds - (60 tracepoints)
        - Live Active Validator - 1 hour / 60 mins / 3600 seconds (3,600 transactions)
        - Live Active Validator - 24 hours / 1440 minutes / 86,400 seconds (86,400 transactions) 

- Token Generation Event - Network Protocol Generates Tokens for Verified Activity Time
- Proof of Activity - Token Generation Event as a result of hybrid computational networks, recording and encrypting activity information, second per second track points.
- Proving human activity to stake reputation on the Proof of Activity as a Stake network.
- Hashing activity from sports tracking apps into IPFS.
- Parsing activity data & digitally signing it into the network.
