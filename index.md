# Activity Consensus Mechanism
 
- Mechanism for data analysis & activity validation. 
- Blockchain network to generating Proof of Activity transactions.
- [Upload Strava activity (.tcx / .gpx / .fit)](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/223297187-How-to-get-your-Activities-to-Strava).


## Proof of Activity as Stake

> - Utilizing Blockchain technology to create a record of activity.
> - Proof of Activity as Stake - validate, sign & activity transactions.
> - Stake activity on the blockchain with Flowstake Activity Nodes
> - Generate block rewards for 'mining' activity. 


### Hybrid Consensus Blockchain Mechanism 

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Problem to Solve

*   Validate identity, record activity & upload activity metrics. 
*   Generate digital transaction & sync activity metrics into blockchain.
*   Staking contract for verified activity via smart contract.
