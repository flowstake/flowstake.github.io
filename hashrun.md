## Activity Staking Blockchain Network
> - Public, Immutable, Activity Records
> - Public Activity Data Hashed into IPFS protocol
> - [github.com/flowstake/readme](https://github.com/flowstake/flowstake.github.io/blob/master/README.md)
> - [github.com/flowstake](https://github.com/flowstake)


## Proof of Activity as Stake
> - Utilizing Blockchain technology to create a timestamped record of activity.
> - Proof of Activity as Stake - hash, validate & stake activity transactions.
> - Each activity is a node, staking runtime to validate proof of activity. 

### Problem to Solve
*   Verify / attest identity, record / hash activity data, digitally sign hashes for activity validation. 
*   Distributed activity attestations & sync activity metrics into blockchain.
*   Staking contract for verified activity via smart contract.

### Proof of Stake - Smart Contract 
> - Hybrid Proof of Stake / Proof of Activity
> - Escrow Time Release Proof of Activity Smart Contract
> - Activity timestamp verified on the blockchain network

### Proof of Activity - Validators 
- Proof of Activity as a Stake - P2P Validators
- To ensure reputable activity data, each node must validate completed activities (x) as transactions to secure network.
- Operate a validator node to stake the network
- Hashes are stored using the IPFS protocol
- Validator nodes verify and stake activity transactions
